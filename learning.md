## Learning


**[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)** is one of my favorite places to learn how to code. It makes finding the syntax for lots of different languages easy. I also remember using **[Code.org](https://code.org/)** when I was younger to learn some of the basics of coding. **[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** has also been useful when working on more complex or personal projects.

I've also found it useful to look at the documentation given by the creators of languages and libraries. I think the ones I've visited the most are the _Bootstrap_ documentation(by a mile) and the documentation for _MongoDB_ and _C#_.
